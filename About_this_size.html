<h1 id="haha1"> About Jen's Kitchen</h1>
<p1>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a
    cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own.
    <i>Bon Appetit!</i>

<br><br>
<p2>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of
    restaurant reviews.</p2>
